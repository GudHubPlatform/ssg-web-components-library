# Description

    This JavaScript code sets the blog title and subtitle based on the current language.

        1. It retrieves the configuration using `window.getConfig()`.
        2. It checks if the configuration, current language, and blog settings exist.
        3. If everything is present, it searches for the settings for the current language and sets the blog title and subtitle. If the settings are not found, default title and subtitle are used.
        4. If the configuration is missing, it logs an error and sets default title and subtitle.

        To make this code work, you need to create these configurations on the client side.
